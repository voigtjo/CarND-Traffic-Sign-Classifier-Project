And here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com/voigtjo/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)### Data Set Summary & Exploration#### 1. Basic summary of the data set. I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the trafficsigns data set:* The size of training set is 34799 * The size of the validation set is 4410 * The size of test set is 12630 * The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32)* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43#### 2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing the histogram of label frequency:![alt text][label_frequency]### Design and Test a Model Architecture#### 1. PreprocessingIn the preprocessing I decided first to shuffle the data an than to normalize the image from value range 0 - 255 to 0.1 - 0.9#### 2. Model ArchitectureI took the LeNet-5 neural network architecture and added dropouts to avoid overfitting.| Layer         		|     Description	        					| |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------| | Input         		| 32x32x3 RGB image   							| | Convolution 3x3     	| stride:1, padding:valid, output shape:28x28x6	|| RELU					|												|| Max pooling	      	| padding:valid, output shape:14x14x6			|| Convolution 3x3	    | stride:1, padding:valid, output shape:10x10x16|| RELU					|												|| Max pooling	      	| padding:valid, output shape:5x5x16			|| Flatten				| output: 400									|| Fully connected		| output: 120       							|| Dropout		        |        										|| RELU					|												|| Fully connected		| output: 84       							    || RELU					|												|| Fully connected		| output: 43       							    |#### 3.Model TrainingI trained the model with a learning rate of 0.001, batch size as 128, 20 epochs and a keeping probability for dropouts of 0.5After each epoch, I measured the accuracy of the validation set. After 10 epochs the accuracy was constantly >0.93. ### Test a Model on New Images#### 1. I've choosen 6 German traffic signs found on the web: * ![alt text][right_of_way]* ![alt text][speed_limit_30]* ![alt text][priority road]* ![alt text][keep_right]* ![alt text][turn_left_ahead]* ![alt text][speed_limit_60]#### 2. Here are the results of the prediction:| Image			               |     Prediction	        		|  Probability         | |------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------:| | Right-of-way next intersection      | Dangerous curve to the right|  100.00% || Speed limit (30km/h)	| Speed limit (30km/h) 	|99.56%  || Priority road			| Priority road			|100.00% || Keep right			| Keep right			|100.00% || Turn left ahead		| Turn left ahead      		|99.99%  || Speed limit (60km/h)	| Speed limit (60km/h)    	|100.00% |The model was able to correctly guess 5 of the 6 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 83%. This is ok, but the classification of the first image is completly wrong.
