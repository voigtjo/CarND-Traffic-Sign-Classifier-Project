#**Project: Traffic Sign Recognition** ---**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**The goals / steps of this project are the following:* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set* Design, train and test a model architecture* Use the model to make predictions on new images* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images* Summarize the results with a written report[//]: # (Image References)[image1]: new-traffic-signs/1.png "Right-of-way at the next intersection"[image2]: new-traffic-signs/2.png "Speed limit (30km/h)"[image3]: new-traffic-signs/3.png "Priority road"[image4]: new-traffic-signs/4.png "Keep right"[image5]: new-traffic-signs/5.png "Turn left ahead"[image6]: new-traffic-signs/6.png "Speed limit (60km/h)"## Rubric Points###Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  ---###Writeup / README####1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. You can use this template as a guide for writing the report. The submission includes the project code.You're reading it! and here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com/voigtjo/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)###Data Set Summary & Exploration####1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the trafficsigns data set:* The size of training set is 34799 * The size of the validation set is 4410 * The size of test set is 12630 * The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32)* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43####2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing the histogram of label frequency..![Image of Label frequency][label_frequency.png]###Design and Test a Model Architecture####1. PreprocessingIn the preprocessing I decided first to shuffle the data an than to normalize the image from value range 0. - 255 to 0.1 - 0.9####2. Model ArchitectureI took the LeNet-5 neural network architecture and added dropouts to avoid overfitting.####3.Model TrainingI trained the model with a learning rate of 0.001, batch size as 128, 20 epochs and a keeping probability for dropouts of 0.5After each epoch, I measured the accuracy of the validation set. After 10 epochs the accuracy was constantly >0.93. ###Test a Model on New Images####1. I've choosen 6 German traffic signs found on the web: ![Right-of-way at the next intersection][new-traffic-signs/1.png] ![Speed limit (30km/h)][new-traffic-signs/2.png] ![Priority road][new-traffic-signs/3.png] ![Keep right][new-traffic-signs/4.png] ![Turn left ahead][new-traffic-signs/5.png] ![Speed limit (60km/h)][new-traffic-signs/6.png] ####2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).Here are the results of the prediction:| Image			        |     Prediction	        		|  Probability         | |:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| | Right-of-way at the next intersection      | Dangerous curve to the right|  100.00% || Speed limit (30km/h)	| Speed limit (30km/h) 	|99.56%  || Priority road			| Priority road			|100.00% || Keep right			| Keep right			|100.00% || Turn left ahead		| Turn left ahead      		|99.99%  || Speed limit (30km/h)	| Speed limit (30km/h)    	|100.00% |The model was able to correctly guess 5 of the 6 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 83%. The classification of the first Image is completly wrong.
